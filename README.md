## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Software Developer with experience in **full-stack web development**, focused on building **scalable, reusable, and well-structured applications**. I have worked on the development of WordPress plugins and on the **migration of legacy systems to modern architectures** using React, Python, and PostgreSQL.

I enjoy working on projects that require **clean architecture**, **modular design**, and **real-world problem solving**, especially in environments where performance, maintainability, and developer experience matter.
